# Getting Started

## Set up Frontend

You must then setup the frontend which handles the user interface and user interaction.

1. install required packages (e.g. pnpm install)
2. populate the env file with the backend url and supabase keys
3. run the frontend (e.g. pnpm run dev)

(if it's not working make sure supabase is started and stripe is listening)
